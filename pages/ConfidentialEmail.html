  <p>Dear <span class="blurred">Anna,</span></p>
  <p>I hope you're doing well. I wanted to inform you about the updated payment conditions starting from next month.</p>

<p>The daily rate will remain <span class="blurred">1000 $</span> for the first two weeks. After that, if everything goes smoothly and the required tasks are completed on time, the rate will increase to <span class="blurred">1300 $</span> per day.</p>

<p>Please feel free to reach out if you have any questions or need clarification. We're always open to transparent communication.</p>
